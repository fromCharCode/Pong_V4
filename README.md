# Pong_V4
My version of a Pong game using LibGDX

I created this game to enhance my programming skills, in which i succeeded.

While doing this project I learned:
- Gradele as a build sysem
- OOP
- how to write reusable code
- many aspects of Java itself, e.g. modules
- a few designpatterns, such as pool, MVC, singleton, and others
