# Pong_V4
My version of a Pong game using LibGDX

This is not the final state of the pong game, but the game is running well.

- Singleplayer vs AI
- Local Multiplayer
- Resizable
- You can set the amount of rounds

there will be added:
- LAN Multiplayer
- different Texturepacks (done)
- changing sound volume (done)
- pickups
- maybe obstacles + different maps
